# Deep Q-Learning: Exploring OpenAI Gym Environments and Enhancing DQN for Optimal Performance

This project is aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of reinforcement learning, specifically focusing on Deep Q-Learning (DQN). The project will involve exploring the OpenAI Gym library, implementing the DQN algorithm as described in DeepMind's seminal paper, and subsequently improving the DQN algorithm for enhanced performance and stability.

## Environments:
- CartPole
- Lunar Lander
